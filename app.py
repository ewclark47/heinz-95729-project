Module handles the functionality of the Google DialogFlow project 
for ScottyBot. 

Use DialogFlow to predict Intent and included Entities from user input (message to ScottyBot). 
The intents, entities, user query and other paramters are fetchted from Dialogflow using a webhook
Based on the intents and entities their respective database functions are performed and then the 
output response is created. The response is then sent to GPT3 for maintaining natural flow and 
then the response is returned to Dialogflow using webhook to publish the response to slack.
The Dialogflow module also has a function to print the predicted results to the console as well
as functions that determine the responses for the user trying to add a course, drop a 
course, find a course or view their schedule. 

This module requires that `flask`, `dotenv`, `openai` be installed within the Python
environment you are running this script in.

This module contains the following functions:

    * webhook - gathers the various parameters from Dialogflow using webhook and returns the 
    response to DialogFlow
    * switch - return the response for user's query and performs database functions
